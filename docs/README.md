## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows a cross-functional and iterative approach. Key activities include project initiation (validating business needs and aligning stakeholders), planning (prioritizing backlogs, creating milestones, and identifying risks), executing workflows using boards, rigorous risk management and communication, standardized release protocols, and post-sprint continuous improvement via retrospectives. Roles (e.g., PM, PdM, developers, QA) are clearly defined and focus on collaboration and stakeholder alignment throughout the project lifecycle.
